Classes
=======

pvlib-python provides a collection of classes
for users that prefer object-oriented programming.
The classes can help users keep track of data in an organized way,
and can help to simplify the modeling process.
The classes do not add any functionality beyond the procedural code.
Most of the object methods are simple wrappers around the
corresponding procedural code.
