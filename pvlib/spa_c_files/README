This folder contains the files required to wrap the NREL SPA algorithm using the Cython package. 

**There are 5 files needed for this, described below:**

spa.c : Original C code from NREL 
spa.h : header file for spa.c

cspa_py.pxd: a cython header file- essentially tells cython which parts of the main header file to pay attention to

spa_py.pyx : the cython code used to define both functions in the python namespace. NOTE: It is possible to provide user access to other paramters of the SPA algorithm through modifying this file 

setup.py: a distutils file which performs the compiling of the cython code

**the process produces two files**

c_adder.c: an intermediate cython c file
c_adder.so: the python module which can be imported into a namespace

in order to process the orignial 5 files, use the following bash command inside this folder

 
 $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

This folder also contains the original test files from the NREL C code. This can be run to check the underlying code using the following shell commands: 

$ gcc spatester.c
$ ./a.out

and should produce the following:
