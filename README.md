pythonic-PVLIB
============

The PV_LIB Toolbox provides a set of well-documented functions for simulating the performance of photovoltaic energy systems. The toolbox was originally developed at Sandia National Laboratories and it implements many of the models and methods developed at the Labs. The libary was originally developed for MATLAB, and then ported to python.

This fork of the first python port was made to refactor the code to be more pythonic. Pythonic code is easier to use, easier to maintain, and faster to develop. Adhering to PEP8 guidelines allows other python developers read code more quickly and accurately. The downside of our approach is that users of the MATLAB PVLIB will need to do more work to port their applications to python.
