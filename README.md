pythonic-PVLIB
============

The PV_LIB Toolbox provides a set of well-documented functions for simulating the performance of photovoltaic energy systems. The toolbox was developed at Sandia National Laboratories and it implements many of the models and methods developed at the Labs. This fork was made to refactor the code to be more pythonic, while preserving the original MATLAB-like code that many users will be more comfortable and familiar with.
