PVLIB_Python
============

The PV_LIB Toolbox provides a set of well-documented functions for simulating the performance of photovoltaic energy systems. The toolbox was developed at Sandia National Laboratories and it implements many of the models and methods developed at the Labs.

Compatibility
=============

PV_LIB is currently compatible with python 2.7.X

Getting Started
===============

After cloning the directory onto your local computer, the best place to start is running the example ipython notebook files (.ipynb)

To start a notebook session, enter the local directory of the PV_LIB library and run 

     ipython notebook --pylab

Notebooks to run
---------------------

*  /tutorial/Tutorial.ipynb for an introduction to the overall functionality 

* /pvlib/Test_scripts_1.ipynb an example of a complete workflow

* /pvlib/TS_2_irradiance_functions.ipynb an example of implementing the included irradiance translation functions
